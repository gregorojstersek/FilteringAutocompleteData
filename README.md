Handles the filtering and returning correct data for the autocomplete.

## Install

Make sure you have nodemon installed as a global package.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

Navigate to the root of the folder and run:

```sh
npm install
```

Let's start the app.

```sh
nodemon server.js
```

That will start the app on localhost:3000
